WIP Chip8 emulator originally started as a fun way to learn the basic techniques of emulation and Swift at the same time.

While it doesn't support input at the moment, it passes all programmes I've found that test for correctness of emulation.

## TODO

* Add support for input
* Add ability to select programmes from a list
